The USB_ROBOTIC_ARM is a proof-of-concept driver for the OWI/Maplin USB
Robotic Arm. I created it for fun. So, don't expect much from it.

INSTALLATION:

Select the 'USB ROBOTIC ARM' and build the kernel.

If we build it as module, locate the robotic_arm.ko

As 'root', insert the module:
# insmod robotic_arm.ko
# dmesg
[ 8808.461441] usbcore: registered new interface driver robotic_arm

Connect the Robotic Arm to the PC.

# dmesg
...
[ 8718.729311] robotic_arm 5-1:1.0: USB ROBOTIC ARM now attached

# cd /sys/bus/usb/drivers/robotic_arm/
In my case,
# ls
5-1:1.0  bind  module  new_id  remove_id  uevent  unbind

# cd 5-1:1.0
# ls
bAlternateSetting  bInterfaceNumber    bNumEndpoints  gripmotor  motor2  power                 uevent
basemotor          bInterfaceProtocol  driver         led        motor3  subsystem
bInterfaceClass    bInterfaceSubClass  ep_81          modalias   motor4  supports_autosuspend

TESTING:

# echo 1 > basemotor
(This will rotate the base clockwise)

# echo 2 > basemotor
(This will rotate the base anti-clockwise)

# echo 0 > basemotor
(This will stop the base motor if it is on)

# echo 1 > led
(This will switch on the front side LED)

# echo 1 > motor3
(This will switch on motor3)
